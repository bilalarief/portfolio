              As a student in my school, apart from using paper for attendance,
              some teachers utilize Google Forms or even WhatsApp to track
              attendance. However, using WhatsApp for attendance poses problems
              as it allows for attendance falsification and can be challenging
              when multiple students are typing simultaneously. I find this
              method to be cumbersome.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              On the teacher's side, they have to create a separate Google Form
              for each class session to record attendance. This process becomes
              more complicated for students as they need to switch between apps
              to mark their attendance. Additionally, students can manipulate
              their attendance by exploiting the Google Forms system.

                    Majority of students in Indonesia face challenges in
                    learning to use new mobile apps, primarily due to limited
                    access to cell phones and the inability to afford internet
                    data plans necessary for internet connectivity. A study
                    conducted by Frontiers in Education highlights these
                    difficulties in more detail{" "}

                    However, it is worth noting that the landscape has changed
                    amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only students but also
                    individuals in general have demonstrated an increased
                    inclination to enhance their technological literacy and
                    knowledge.

                    So, I have implemented a{" "}

                    within the app. When students open the app, the first thing
                    they encounter is a prominent attendance status. This
                    ensures that attendance information is immediately visible
                    and easily accessible to both students and teachers,
                    fostering a seamless and efficient attendance management
                    system.

                    For this particular feature, the attendance button takes
                    center stage as the primary function of the app. I have
                    strategically positioned it in the middle of the navigation
                    and distinguished it with a distinct color from other
                    buttons.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    This deliberate design choice ensures that users immediately
                    recognize the button's purpose for attending classes.

                      Although this issue pertains more to the development of
                      the app rather than the design, it is worth mentioning.
                      During the attendance filling process, there is a
                      possibility for students to bypass the location tracking
                      when they are outside the school area, which should not be
                      allowed.

                      Due to the tight deadline, I didn't have enough time to
                      design the screen for the crucial feature meant for
                      teachers. Therefore, this app is solely focused on
                      students, while the teacher's functionality is limited to
                      the website version. Although I understand the importance
                      of designing for the website, the constraints of the
